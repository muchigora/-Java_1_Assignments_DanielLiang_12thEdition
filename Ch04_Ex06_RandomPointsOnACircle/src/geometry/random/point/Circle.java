/**
 * Chapter 04 Exercise 6 Random points on a circle
 * Write a program that generates three random points on a circle centered at (0, 0) with radius 40 
 * and displays three angles in a triangle formed by these three points, as shown in Figure 4.4a. 
 * Display the angles in degrees.
 * (a) A triangle is formed from three random points on the circle. 
 * (b) A random point on the circle can be generated using a random angle a. 
 * (c) A pentagon is centered at (0, 0) with one point at the 0 o’clock position.
