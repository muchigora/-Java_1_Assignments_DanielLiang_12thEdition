/**
 * Ch3 Ex26 Geometry: intersecting point
 * Two points on line 1 are given as (x1, y1) and x2, y2) and on line 2 as (x3, y3) and (x4, y4), 
 * as shown in Figure 3.8a and b. 
 * The intersecting point of the two lines can be found by solving the following linear equations
 * (y1 - y2)x - (x1 - x2)y = (y1 - y2)x1 - (x1 - x2)y1
 * (y3 - y4)x - (x3 - x4)y = (y3 - y4)x3 - (x3 - x4)y3
 * This linear equation can be solved using Cramer’s rule (see Programming Exercise  3.3). 
 * If the equation has no solutions, the two lines are parallel (see M03_LIAN9966_12_SE_C03.indd 115 28/09/19 3:54 PM Figure 3.8c). 
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter four points and displays the intersecting point. Here are sample run
 *
