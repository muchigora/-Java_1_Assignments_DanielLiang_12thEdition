/**Ch03 Ex11: Palindrome integer
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter a three-digit integer and determines 
 * whether it is a palindrome integer. An integer is palindrome if it reads the same from 
 * right to left and from left to right. A negative integer is treated the same as a 
 * positive integer. Here are sample runs of this program:
 * -> Enter a three-digit integer: 121 result: 121 is a palindrome
 * -> Enter a three-digit integer: 123 result: 123 is not a palindrome
