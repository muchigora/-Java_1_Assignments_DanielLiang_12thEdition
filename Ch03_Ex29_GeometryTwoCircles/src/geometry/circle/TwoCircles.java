/**
 * Ch03 Ex 29: Geometry: two circles
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter the center coordinates and radii of two circles 
 * and determines whether the second circle is inside the first or overlaps with the first, as shown 
 * in Figure 3.10. (Hint: circle2 is inside circle1 if the distance between the two 
 * centers <= r1 âˆ’ r2 and circle2 overlaps circle1 if the distance between the two centers 
 * >=r1 + r2. 
 * Test your program to cover all cases. (See question image attached)
