/**
 * Ch03 Ex 23 Geometry: point in a rectangle?
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter a point (x, y) and checks whether the point is within 
 * the rectangle centered at (0, 0) with width 10 and height 5. For example, (2, 2) is inside the rectangle 
 * and (6, 4) is outside the rectangle, as shown in Figure 3.7b. 
 * (Hint: A point is in the rectangle if its horizontal distance to (0, 0) is less than or equal to 10 / 2 and 
 * its vertical distance to (0, 0) is less than or equal to 5.0 / 2. Test your program to cover all cases.) 
 * Here are two sample runs:
