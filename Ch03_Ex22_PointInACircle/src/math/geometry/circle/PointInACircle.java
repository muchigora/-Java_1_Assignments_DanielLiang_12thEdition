/**
 * Chapter 3 Exercise 22 Geometry: Point in a Circle?
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter a point (x, y) and checks whether the point is within 
 * the circle centered at (0, 0) with radius 10. 
 * For example, (4, 5) is inside the circle and (9, 9) is outside the circle, as shown in Figure 3.7a.
 * (Hint: A point is in the circle if its distance to (0, 0) is less than or equal to 10. 
 * The formula for computing the distance is sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2). 
 * Test your program to cover all cases.) Two sample runs are shown below(see attached image of question)
